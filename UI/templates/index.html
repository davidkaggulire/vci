                    Version for Children Initiative (VCI) is a community based child oriented nongovernmental organization formed in 2015 with the objectives of promoting Children’s Right and development through promotion of Education, WASH, Health and livelihood programs in Communities. The organization was founded by three women with a common vision and objectives to promote children’s rights and development in the needy communities of the world. Their dream was driven by the sights and documentaries of continues and endless needs for actions to prevent human right abuses especially child right abuses that expose children to conditions that undermine the attainment of rights in a dignified manner especially in the underserved communities. Due to various shocks that affect underserved communities children are not provided access to quality Health services and facilities especially Child Care and Adolescent Reproductive Health, quality education, opportunity to participate in decision making on issues that affect their development including access to information.

                    also unable to fulfil the required livelihood necessities for children’s growth. Version for children initiative shall therefore strife to fulfil her objectives to fill the gaps in children’s attainment to their rights.
